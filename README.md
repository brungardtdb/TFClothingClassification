# TFClothingClassification
A Tensorflow neural net that recognizes items of clothing and classifies them.
Part of a free Tensorflow course offered by Udacity, takes in an array of pixels as input and outputs 10 probabilities between 0 and 1. The closer to 1 the number is, the more likely that is the item of clothing being evaluated.
